# Investigate-a-Data-Set
## Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree Project - Investigate a Data Set

In this project, I will be analysing a dataset of medical appointments to determine whether certain factors may be influencing whether a patient shows up for their scheduled appointment. This dataset contains over 100,000 medical appointments in Brazil from May 2016 (source: Kaggle). Python with pandas, numpy, seaborn and matplotlib libraries will be used for the data analysis.
